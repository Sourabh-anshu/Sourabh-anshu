## 👨‍💻 Coding Journey
<p>
  I started my coding journey with Python, building a strong foundation in programming basics. Later, I transitioned to Java as per my company’s requirement, which opened the door to understanding object-oriented programming in greater depth.
One of the biggest resources that helped me improve my problem-solving skills was Striver’s DSA Sheet. The structured roadmap and clear teaching style made learning DSA a lot easier and more enjoyable.
Alongside daily DSA practice, I actively work on building projects using React to strengthen my frontend development skills. These projects help me apply what I learn and explore modern web technologies.I practice regularly on platforms like LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks to stay consistent and improve my coding speed and logic. My goal is to become a well-rounded software developer who can design scalable solutions and build impactful applications.
I love exploring new technologies, learning best practices, and continuously pushing myself to grow in both frontend development and problem-solving.
